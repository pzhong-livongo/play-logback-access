# Logback-access plugin for Play 2

This plugin allows you to use [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch)'s very flexible [access](http://logback.qos.ch/access.html) framework within [Play](http://www.playframework.com).


## Installation

Add JitPack resolver and the dependency

    resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.cardamo" % "play-logback-access" % "0.7.0"

Play version compatibility:

| play version | lib version |
|--------------|-------------|
| 2.8.x        | 0.7.0       |
| 2.7.x        | 0.6.2       |
| 2.6.x        | 0.6.2       |
| 2.5.14+      | 0.5.3       |

## Configuration

Add a configuration file to your `conf/application.conf` with something like:

    logbackaccess.config.resource=logback-access.xml
    play.modules.enabled += org.databrary.PlayLogbackAccessModule
    play.filters.enabled += org.databrary.PlayLogbackAccessFilter

Then in `conf/logback-access.xml`:

```xml
<configuration>
  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%t %D %s %h %b %A "%r" "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}"</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
</configuration>
```

(You can alternatively use `logbackaccess.config.file` or `logbackaccess.config.url`.)

You can read more about the supported [patterns](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#logback-access).
Note that patterns requiring access to the full request body or response body (including content-length) do not currently provide useful data.

There is also a `logbackaccess.context` setting if you want it to use an [execution context other than the default one](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ThreadPools).


## Usage

The library is a [Play Module](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/Modules) which
you need to enable by adding this to application's `.conf` file:

    play.modules.enabled += "org.databrary.PlayLogbackAccessModule"

(if you experience any issues with dependency injection (esp. during tests), please try using `PlayLogbackAccessLazyInjectModule` which does the lazy dependency injection)

Inject `PlayLogbackAccessApi` into any class to gain access to the API. This exposes:
- `log(requestTime: Long, request: RequestHeader, result: Result, user: Option[String])` - Manually log to the Access logger

Inject `PlayLogbackAccessFilter` to access a Filter (in 0.4 and earlier this was available as `filter` on the above)

### Usage before version 0.5.3
